# Identifying-Optimal-Algorithm-for-Shortest-Path
Comparison can be an important problem in graph theory because analysis shows algorithms can be
optimal in different circumstances, depending on tradeoffs between computation and communication
costs. Therefore, by determining CPU time for a given set of inputs relating to that particular
circumstances, the issue can be resolved to an extent.
